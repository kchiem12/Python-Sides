First of all, let me get something straight: This
is a Journal, not a diary. I know what it
says on the cover, but when Mom went out to
buy this thing I specifically told her to
get one that didn’t say “diary” on it.
Great. All I need is for some jerk to catch me
carrying this book around and get the wrong idea.
The other thing I want to clear up right away
is that this was mom’s idea, not mine.
But if she thinks I’m going to write down my
“feelings” in here or whatever, she’s crazy. So
just don’t expect me to be all “Dear Diary” this
and “Dear Diary” that.
The only reason I agreed to do this at all is
because I figure later on when I’m rich and
famous, I’ll have better things to do than
answer people’s stupid questions all day long. So
this book is gonna come in handy.
Like I said, I’ll be famous one day, but for now
I’m stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons.
